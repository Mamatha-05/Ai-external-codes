Travelling Salesman Problem

The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic optimization problem. It involves finding the shortest route that visits a set of cities and returns to the origin. TSP is an NP-hard problem with many real-world applications.

Depth-First Search

Depth-First Search (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm. It explores a graph or tree by visiting a node and its neighbors before backtracking. DFS is useful for searching, traversal, and finding connectedÂ components.
